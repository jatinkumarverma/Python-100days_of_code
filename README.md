# 100 Days of Code in Python
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code in Python GitHub repository. In this challenge, I will be creating a project every day for the next 100 days using Python programming language.

## What is this challenge about?
The 100 Days of Code is a coding challenge that encourages participant to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. The goal of this challenge is to help participant build a strong coding habit, improve their coding skills, and work on interesting projects.

In this particular challenge, I will be focusing on Python programming language and will be creating a new project every day. These projects will range from small applications to larger projects that require more advanced skills.

## How to use this repository
Each day, I will be creating a new project and adding it to this repository. The projects will be organized into separate folders, with each folder representing a different day.

To access a project, simply navigate to the corresponding folder for that day. In each folder, you will find the code for that day's project, as well as a README file that provides more information about the project.

You are welcome to use these projects as a learning resource or as inspiration for your own projects. Feel free to fork this repository and make your own changes and improvements.
